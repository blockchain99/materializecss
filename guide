What do you mean by "live server"? Would you like to test website on your local network? If so, the easiest solution is (assuming you have node.js installed) to install http-server command-line tool. Install it globally with 

$sudo npm install http-server -g, 

then navigate (of course in terminal) to the directory where your website is and 

type http-server command. 


Message like this will appear: Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://192.168.1.6:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

To launch your website on your machine or another machine on the same network, just go to http:// ip :8080

If you don't have node.js, Python also offers similar command-line tool. You can use it with:

    If Python version is 3.X python -m http.server
    If Python version is 2.X python -m SimpleHTTPServer
